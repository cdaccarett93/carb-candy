**Carb Candy** is an app based on [Chris Hannemann's](https://github.com/channemann/push-button-get-candy) push-button-get-candy project. Carb Candy calculates how much candy (skittles) you need to eat based on your current blood sugar level to your intended target level.

### Candy Calculation
All calculation formulas are based on how-much-candy for more detailed documentation [click-here](https://github.com/channemann/push-button-get-candy/wiki/2.-How-Much-Candy%3F) <br>

The basic formula for determining how much candy should be dispensed is

`nSkittles = (treatmentTarget - glucose) / (CSF x carbsPerSkittle)`
